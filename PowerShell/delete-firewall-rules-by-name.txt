To delete or remove all the firewall rules that are named "bad ip" on your Windows 10, you can use the following steps:

- Open Command Prompt as an administrator. You can do this by typing "cmd" in the search box and right-clicking on the Command Prompt app and choosing "Run as administrator".
- In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:

`netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="bad ip" | findstr /i "name:"`

This command will list all the firewall rules that have the name "bad ip" and display their names.

- Copy the names of the firewall rules that you want to delete. You can do this by selecting them with your mouse and pressing Ctrl+C.
- To delete a firewall rule, type the following command and press Enter:

`netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="<rule name>"`

Replace `<rule name>` with the name of the firewall rule that you copied. For example, if you want to delete a rule named "bad ip 1", type:

`netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="bad ip 1"`

- Repeat this step for each firewall rule that you want to delete. Alternatively, you can use a wildcard character (*) to delete multiple rules at once. For example, if you want to delete all the rules that start with "bad ip", type:

`netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="bad ip*"`

- To verify that the firewall rules have been deleted, type the following command and press Enter:

`netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="bad ip"`

This command will show no results if the firewall rules have been successfully deleted.
